# This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the Auto data 
# set.
library("ISLR")
data(Auto)
#
# (a) Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the 
# data set.
pairs(Auto)
#
# (b) Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the 
# function cor(). You will need to exclude the name variable, which is 
# qualitative.
Auto.sub <- Auto[-9]
cor(Auto.sub)
# 
# (c) Use the lm() function to perform a multiple linear regression with mpg as
# the response and all other variables except name as the predictors. Use the 
# summary() function to print the results. 
reg <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = Auto.sub) 
summary(reg)
# Comment on the output. For instance:
## i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
## F-statistic: 256.7 on 7 and 389 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
## ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship 
## to the response?
## Displacement (*), weight (***), acceleration (*), year (***), origin (***)
## iii. What does the coefficient for the year variable suggest?
##  Every year the mpg increases on average by 0.7734.
#
# (d) Use the plot() function to produce diagnostic plots of the linear 
# regression fit.
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(reg)
# Comment on any problems you see with the fit. Do the residual plots suggest 
# any unusually large outliers? Does the leverage plot identify any 
# observations with unusually high leverage?
# Yes, see the plots.
#
# (e) Use the * and : symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction 
# effects. Do any interactions appear to be statistically significant?
reg.int <- lm(mpg ~ weight*year*origin, data = Auto.sub)
summary(reg.int)
#
# (f) Try a few different transformations of the variables, such as log(X), âˆšX,
# X2. Comment on your findings.
reg.tr1 <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower + log(horsepower) + weight*year*origin, 
              data = Auto.sub)
summary(reg.tr1)

reg.tr2 <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower + sqrt(horsepower) + weight*year*origin, 
              data = Auto.sub)
summary(reg.tr2)

reg.tr3 <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2) + weight*year*origin, 
              data = Auto.sub)
